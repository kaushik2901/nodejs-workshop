# TODO for us before sending assignment

- Create final two frontend pages (from current public folder code or cloned folder code or anything else! )
  - Movie List
  - Movie create / edit form 
  
- Create API with & without joi & mongoose

- Logic is two seperate pages would be better and we can extend same application for auth afterwards
- So in next demo we will show joi, mongoose, auth & third party API calling / pupptere with this idea only !
- After all this we will show better folder structure and sepearte maybe a react example too for them to understand
- Maybe in this application show ejs so both ssr & api is covered!
- Deploy this 
- wrap up seminar with socket demo or interview question and mostly
