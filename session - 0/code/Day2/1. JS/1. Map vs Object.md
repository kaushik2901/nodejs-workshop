## Map Vs Object

- A Map object can **iterate its elements in insertion order** - a for..of loop will return an array of [key, value] for each iteration.

- Use maps over objects when keys are unknown until run time, and when all keys are the same type and all values are the same type.

- Use objects when there is logic that operates on individual elements.

- An Object has a prototype (But can be removed)
  
- You can get the size of a Map easily while you have to manually keep track of size for an Object

- Map requires more memory & lesser performant compared to object
